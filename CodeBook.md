# How it works:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Reading the test datasset
Rename columns to human readable names
Combine the columns of activityID, subjectID, and the data together

Reading the train datasset
Rename columns to human readable names
Combine the columns of activityID, subjectID, and the data together


now merge test and train datasets
Add the acitivty labels corresponding to each activityID
We are only interest in mean and std measurements, so just picks those columns

Write the ouput required for task1


Average by acitivty and subject for each of the variables
